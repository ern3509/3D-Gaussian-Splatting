# 3D-Gaussian-Splatting
Gaussian Splatting has completely changed the field of reconstruction, the 2D but most particularly the 3D reconstruction field. Simplely explained, the methods consist of mapping multiples gaussians(Hundred, thousand) to a 3D scene. This explanation might be unclear now but will take all its sense in the next minutes.

Here is a simple overview of thw Gaussian Splatting method:
