# 3D-Gaussian-Splatting
## Simple explanation
Gaussian Splatting has completely changed the field of reconstruction, the 2D but most particularly the 3D reconstruction field. Simplely explained, the methods consist of mapping multiples gaussians(Hundred, thousand) to a 3D scene. This explanation might be unclear now but will take all its sense in the next minutes.

Here is a simple overview of thw Gaussian Splatting method:

### Gaussian initalisation
The first step of the method is the placement of isotropic gaussian all over the scene. Here comes the first parameter of the gaussians, their positions. The initial positions come from sparse point cloud generated by COLMAPâ€™s Structure-from-Motion (SfM) stage.

### Optimization
I introduced the first parameter of the Gaussians, it is time to talk about the other ones:
- Rotation/Orienation: Defines how the 3D Gaussian is rotated in space, controlling its anisotropic shape direction.
- Opacity: Controls how transparent or solid the Gaussian appears when splatted into the image.
- Spherial harmonics: A compact mathematical representation of the view-dependent color the Gaussian emits, enabling realistic lighting effects.

The goal of the optimization process is to find the optimal set of parameter for each gaussian.
The gaussian parameter and the camera parameter(extrinsic and intrinsic) are use to project the gaussian coordinates back into the image space. The tile rasterizer renders the projected Gaussians into pixels, blending their contributions to produce the image. The loss is then computed between the rendered image and the ground truth view.

## Training
I attached a google colab notebook which will help you to easily train the 3D Gaussian model for the first time. To train the model, you need a T4 GPU(You can buy some user-time foro 10 bucks)
